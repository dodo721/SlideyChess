# Slidey Chess
A cursed version of chess because everything else in life is cursed right now, so why not chess too?

Currently WIP.

Includes a custom written 2D polygon transformation and collision engine, written in JavaScript.

# How to run
**Client** is a React app served through webpack, run `npm start` for dev or `npm build` for release

**Server** is an Express NodeJS app, run with `cd src/server && node index.js`
